JUnit under Fitnesse


Mission

### JUnit under Fitnesse ###

Lets see some tests that were written in JUnit, running under fitnesse, see their names and their success status, and also, make their names easy to read!

These tests could be integration test, or straight unit tests.

Why
===

Fitnesse is a great way to write business oriented tests.

However there are tests we've written that also fill these needs, and may be shown just for documentation. I am talking here, of course, about JUnit tests.

In a typical TDD environment we have hundreds or thousands of these tests, and some of them fill a specific business need. Whether it's edge case validation, or some complex pricing model, we can view these tests and run them from within Fitnesse.

We should be able to see the names of the tests, and perhaps do some rough wikification on the camel cased names.

Either way, Spritnesse is here.
