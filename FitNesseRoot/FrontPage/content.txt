!1 Spritnesse

I like fitnesse because it runs in a browser and testers can see what's going on.

I don't like fitnesse because it's a terrible language and ends up with over wrought, un refactorable tests.

I love junit, spock, cucumber and a whole bunch of other testing frameworks.

What if we could join these up?

Well now you can, with '''Spritnesse'''
