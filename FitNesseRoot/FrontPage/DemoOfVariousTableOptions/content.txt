!1 Demo of features - there are some failing tests on this page, as demonstrations



Has to be Slim

!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

Need the spritnesse project jar

!path ./spritnesse-proj/target/spritnesse-proj.jar

Need the jars, with dependencies, of all tests I need to run

!path ./test-junit/target/test-junit-jar-with-dependencies.jar
!path ./test-spock/target/test-spock-jar-with-dependencies.jar
!path ./test-cucumber/target/test-cucumber-jar-with-dependencies.jar

|import                  |
|org.oxenburgh.spritnesse|

!1 To make this work

You need to include the jar you want to test in both the !path statement, and as an argument to the table. You will need the 

This is because of the way Fitnesse (and java) handles the class path. To get a list of tests, we need to specify a jar. To run those tests, that jar will need to be in the class path

There are alternatives to this, but this worked for me.

For spock and other environments, you'll need to make that environment available to fitnesse. I found a good way was to package the env up in the jar. You can look in the pom.xml for test-spock
as an example.

!2 Spock tests
